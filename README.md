# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?
## Background
### Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

### Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."

### But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

### I found through my random sample of 500 locations that the temperature does in fact get warmer towards the equator.

### Below is a scatter plot showing the max temperature rising as locations get closer to the equator in the northern hemisphere.

### And here we can see the max temperatures dropping in locations as they get further from the equator in the southern hemisphere.

### Based off the DataFrame we built for the WeatherPy activity. This map features locations that offer hotels in ideal conditions where the max temperature is between 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit, the wind speed is less than 10 mph, and the cloudiness factor is less than 5.
